# Service-Template-Collection
This repository is a hub for all my service templates, the idea is to be able to quickly and efficiently setup new microservies or monoliths with only one dependancy - Docker.

## Complete
These may be lacking in some way, but I consider these ready-to-go, keep in mind that further configuration is likely required depending on your use-case.
- [Laravel + Php-fpm + nginx](https://github.com/yonatan-ratner/laravel-service-template)
- [C++](https://github.com/yonatan-ratner/CMake-vcpkg-template)

## WIP
These are available but are not yet complete, due to varying reasons - do not expect these to work.
- [Node](https://github.com/yonatan-ratner/node-service-template)
- [Go](https://github.com/yonatan-ratner/go-service-template)

## Planned
These are just languages and frameworks that either pique my interest or are extremely popular.
- JavaScript (no framework)
- React
- Angular
- Vue
- Elixir
- C#
- Maui 
- Java
- Kotlin
